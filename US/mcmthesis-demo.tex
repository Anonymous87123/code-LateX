\title{Modeling and Predicting the Time-To-Empty of Lithium-ion Batteries in Smartphones}

\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
\par 
Smartphones,a kind of indispensable tool in modern life,have a battery performance which usually appears somewhat unpredictable, but this is not the case in reality.In order to predict the time-to-empty of lithium-ion batteries in smartphones under different conditions, we developed a continuous-time mathematical model for smartphone batteries, and successfully transformed our research results into practical recommendations for mobile phone users.

Initially,we started with the simplest and most reasonable description of battery power consumption, and then expanded it to incorporate factors such as screen usage, processor load, network connection, background applications, GPS usage, environmental factors, and others. We developed a model that returns the state of charge (SOC) as a function of time under actual usage conditions.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Problem Background}

Smartphones have become integral to contemporary living, yet their battery performance remains highly inconsistent. A device might operate seamlessly for a full day under moderate use, but in other instances, it may deplete rapidly—even before midday. While many users attribute such variations to "frequent usage", the underlying causes of battery drain are far more complex. Key determinants include screen dimensions and brightness settings, computational load imposed by the processor, network-related activities, and background processes from applications that continue to consume power even when the phone appears idle. External conditions also exert considerable influence: certain batteries exhibit reduced efficiency in colder climates and are susceptible to overheating during sustained high-demand tasks. Moreover, the battery’s historical usage patterns and charging behaviors significantly shape its long-term performance and reliability.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Usage Pattern Factors}
Individual usage habits significantly impact battery performance:
\begin{itemize}
\item Frequency and intensity of usage (moderate vs. heavy use)
\item Historical battery usage patterns over time\cite{3}
\item Charging behaviors and methods employed
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Hardware, Software and Configuration Factors}
Device-specific characteristics and settings play a crucial role:
\begin{itemize}
\item Screen dimensions and physical size
\item Brightness level settings configured by the user
\item Computational load imposed by the processor during operation
\end{itemize}
Background processes and network activities contribute to power drain:
\begin{itemize}
\item Network-related activities and data transmission
\item Background processes from applications running during idle states
\item Persistent background application consumption even when phone appears inactive
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Environmental Conditions}
External physical conditions exert a direct and sometimes significant influence on battery efficiency\cite{born2006}. On one hand, lithium-ion batteries commonly exhibit reduced operational efficiency and effective capacity when exposed to colder climates and low temperatures. At low temperatures, the internal resistance of the battery increases, the battery capacity significantly decreases, and the voltage may drop below the lowest allowable voltage, making it impossible for the battery to function properly\cite{2}.On the other hand, during periods of sustained high-demand processing tasks, these batteries are particularly susceptible to overheating, which can further degrade performance and long-term health. Finally, broader external temperature variations encountered during normal device operation consistently impact the rate of power drain and overall battery behavior.

\subsection{Restatement of the Problem}

Considering the background information and restricted conditions identified in the problem statement, the following problems we need to solve are listed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Problem 1:} Develop a model that uses continuous-time equations or systems of equations to represent the battery's state of charge, that is, establish a differential equation system that describes the change of state of charge (SOC) over time.
\item {\bf Problem 2:} Use our model to calculate or approximate the emptying time for various initial battery charge levels and usage scenarios. Compare the predicted results with observed or reasonable behaviors, quantify the uncertainty, and determine in which aspects the model performs well or poorly.
\item {\bf Problem 3:} Test the robustness of the model. This involves systematically altering the modeling assumptions, adjusting key parameters, and simulating different variations in usage patterns to analyze the extent to which these changes affect the final prediction results of the model.
\item {\bf Problem 4:} Translate the research findings into practical operational suggestions for mobile users, and explore how the operating system can implement more proactive and effective dynamic power management strategies based on the core insights of the model. At the same time, analyze the feasibility and potential value of extending this modeling framework to other portable electronic devices.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Literature Review}

This issue focuses on the complex and seemingly unpredictable nature of smartphone battery drain. In recent years, research on power consumption models for portable devices has focused on both the underlying physical principles of lithium-ion batteries and the development of suitable continuous-time mathematical frameworks.
\begin{itemize}
\item During the use or storage of lithium batteries, certain degrees of failure may occur, including capacity reduction, short cycle life, increased internal resistance, abnormal voltage,and lithium precipitation, which significantly reduce the performance, consistency, reliability, and safety of lithium batteries\cite{4}.Some researchers also studied the changes in capacity and temperature rise of NCM pouch-type lithium-ion batteries under different operating temperature conditions\cite{5}.Based on previous studies, it was found that at low temperatures, lithium-ion batteries would exhibit phenomena such as lithium precipitation and increased impedance, which significantly affected the performance of lithium-ion batteries. 
\item Some simple continuous-time models, such as Enhanced Coulomb Counting, were used to analysed similar problems. However, its weakness will be exposed when we introduce nonlinear factors and consider the influence of internal resistance and temperature on the capacity of lithium-ion batteries, which is what Problem A specifically requires us to do\cite{6}.Deterministic scenario simulation is often used to predict the time when power runs out. However, in reality, user behavior is not constant, and this kind of prediction is overly idealized.Local sensitivity analysis is often used to observe how much the "time-to-empty" changes when only one parameter is altered.Unfortunately,factors that affect the performance of lithium batteries in smartphones may interact with each other, and this method is unable to study such interactions\cite{7}.
\end{itemize}
The advantages and disadvantages of the three basic models are shown below in \ref{fig1}.

\subsection{Our work}




\section{Model Preparation}
\subsection{Assumptions and Justifications}

In addressing real-world problems that inherently involve numerous complex variables, our initial step involved formulating reasonable assumptions to simplify the modeling process, with each assumption accompanied by its corresponding justification.

\begin{itemize}
\item{\bf Assumption:} The smartphones use lithium-ion batteries.
\item {\bf Justification:} The problem requires us to assume that smartphones use lithium-ion batteries.
\item {\bf Assumption:} The data we use are accurate and valid.
\item {\bf Justification:} Our data is collected from official technical specifications from manufacturers like Apple, some other official web sites and research papers, so it’s reasonable to assume the high quality of their data.
\item {\bf Assumption:}Differential equations can be used to describe the process of how the battery's state changes over time.
\item {\bf Justification:}Differential equations are ideal for modeling continuous battery dynamics, as they capture real-time rate changes based on physical laws like energy conservation, aligning with the problem's requirement for a continuous-time approach.
\item{\bf Assumption:} The battery's internal resistance and effective capacity vary linearly with temperature within typical operating ranges (e.g., 10°C to 25°C).
\item {\bf Justification:} Empirical studies on lithium-ion batteries show that temperature effects on internal resistance and capacity can be approximated linearly for short-term predictions, balancing model accuracy and simplicity.
\item{\bf Assumption:} Power consumption from individual components (e.g., screen, CPU) is additive and can be modeled as a linear function of their operating states (e.g., brightness, load).
\item {\bf Justification:} This simplifies the integration of multiple power sources into a total system power consumption, supported by the superposition principle in circuit theory, and aligns with the continuous-time equation framework required by the problem.
\item {\bf Assumption:} Background application power consumption remains constant during idle periods unless explicitly changed by user activity.
\item {\bf Justification:} This reflects typical smartphone behavior where background tasks (e.g., push notifications) maintain a steady low-level energy draw, as noted in Document 1's discussion of "background applications that continue drawing energy."
\item {\bf Assumption:} Battery aging effects are negligible over the short-term simulations (e.g., a single day) but follow an exponential decay model for long-term analysis.
\item {\bf Justification:} Aging primarily impacts capacity over many charge cycles; ignoring it for daily use simplifies the model without significant loss of accuracy, while incorporating it via an exponential function ensures scalability for extended studies.
\end{itemize}

\section{Model I:A differential equation system}

\subsection{Construct an equivalent circuit model（ECM）}

Based on the relevant literature, we firstly defined the battery state（State of Charge,SOC）as the presentage of the current remaining capacity relative to the rated capacity:
\[SOC(t)=\frac{Q(t)}{C}\times 100\%\]
Here,$Q(t)$represents the remaining battery power at time $t$,and $C$ is the battery capacity（measured in mAh）.This provides a standardized starting point for modeling battery discharge under various conditions, ensuring consistency in time-to-empty predictions and simplifying initial value problems in differential equations.




\subsection{}

In order to describe our process of calculating the value of ? more clearly. We draw
the flowchart Figure \ref{fig2} below.

\begin{figure}[H]    % H表示强制固定在当前位置

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fig2.jpg}
\caption{Calculation procedure for EAL} \label{fig2}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{}


\noindent where $R$ represents $Risk$.

This risk equation of $R$ includes three components: a natural hazards risk component, a
consequence enhancing component, and a consequence reduction component. $EAL$ is the natural
hazards risk component, measuring the expected loss of building value, population, and/or
agriculture value each year due to natural hazards. $CRF$ incorporates both the consequence
enhancing component, denoted as $SV$, and the consequence reduction component, represented
by $CR$.

For Equation \eqref{eq8}, values for Risk and $EAL$ are in units of dollars, representing the community’s
average economic loss from natural hazards each year. For $SV$ and $CR$, values are the
index values for the community provided by the source data sets.

For Equation \eqref{eq9}, each component is represented by a score that represents a community’s
percentile ranking relative to all other communities at the same level. The composite risk score
is calculated to measure a community’s risk to all $18$ hazard types. And it is also a community’s
percentile ranking in risk compared to all other communities at the same level. The risk score
and $EAL$ score are provided as both composite scores from the summation of all $18$ hazard
types.

We used the K-algorithm to categorize the disaster levels into five classes, as shown in
Figure \ref{fig3}.

\subsection{Insurance Premium}

Generally, the companies adopt the principle of Level Premium to determine the price of
insurance. The company calculate the pure premium by using a pre-determined claim rate and
a desired return on investment. The total premium is then obtained by adding surcharges at a
certain expense ratio. Then, the total premium is obtained by adding surcharges at a certain
expense ratio. Insurance companies increase their profitability by increasing expense ratios and
reducing expected returns on investment. In addition, they utilize the ‘Law of Large Numbers’
to set the overall payout ratio of the product so that it basically matches the statistical data, thus
reducing the company's exposure to the risk of fluctuating payout ratios. For catastrophe insurance
pricing, a natural disaster can cause huge property damage when it occurs. The insurance
company may have a risk of becoming insolvent.

In finance, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a model used to determine a theoretically
appropriate required rate of return of an asset, to make decisions about adding assets
to a well-diversified portfolio \cite{li2002}.

The reward-to-risk ratio for any individual security in the market is equal to the market
reward-to-risk ratio, thus

\begin{equation}
\frac{E(r_i)-r_f}{\beta_i} = E(r_m)-r_f
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\beta_i = \frac{\mathrm{Cov}(R_i,R_m)}{\mathrm{Var}(R_m)} = \rho(i,m) \frac{\sigma_i}{\sigma_m}
\end{equation}

\noindent where

\begin{itemize}
\item $E(r_{i})$ is the expected return on the capital asset,
\item $E(r_{m})$ is the expected return of the market,
\item $r_{f}$ is the risk-free rate of interest such as interest arising from government bonds,
\item $\beta_{i}$ is the sensitivity of the expected excess asset returns to the expected excess market returns,
\item $\rho(i,m)$ denotes the correlation coefficient between the investment $i$ and the market $m$,
\item $\sigma_{i}$ is the standard deviation for the investment $i$,
\item $\sigma_m$ is the standard deviation for the investment $m$.
\end{itemize}

Expected return on investment (ROI):

\begin{equation}
ROI = \int \frac{-A \times l(p)+(1+x)A \times R_{Value}-I}{I}f(p) \mathrm{d}p
\end{equation}

Variance of ROI:

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Var}(ROI) = \int \bigg[\frac{-A \times l(p)+A(1+x) \times R_{value}-l-(Ax \times 
R_{value}-l)}{I}\bigg]^2 f(p) \mathrm{d}p
\end{equation}

\noindent where

\begin{itemize}
\item $A$ is the sum insured,
\item $I$ is the invested capital,
\item $l(p)$ is the loss function,
\item $x$ is the surcharge rate.
\end{itemize}

The surcharge rate $x$ is a multiple of the average value of the loss:

\begin{equation}
x = \frac{\Big(1+r_f+\rho \times \frac{(A/I) \times \sigma}{\sigma_M} \times 
(r_M-r_f) \Big) \times I}{A \times R_{value}} \label{eq14}
\end{equation}

where $\sigma$ is the Standard deviation of $R_{value}$, $y$ is Pure premium per $\$10,000$:

\begin{equation}
y = 10000(1+x) \times P
\end{equation}

\noindent where $P$ is the probability of a disaster causing damage.

Typically, it is more reasonable to spend $3-10$ percent of each person's annual income on
insurance.We assume that each person is willing to spend $5\%$ of his or her annual income each
year to purchase catastrophe insurance with a one-year term. Insurance companies can make
decisions from two perspectives based on the above formula:

\begin{itemize}
\item Introducing bankruptcy theory, after calculating the lowest order price, y, in the case
where the probability of the firm's future bankruptcy is less than $10\%$, and then comparing
it to the local per capita annual disposable income (GNI), it is expected that
people in the locality will not be able to afford to consume catastrophe insurance and
will not invest in it if the ratio of premiums per $10,000$ to GNI is greater than $5\%$.

\item We use $5\%$ of the local national GNI per capita as the subscription price per $\$10,000$
of premium. If this price makes the likelihood of future insolvency of the company
higher than $10\%$, no investment is made in that location.
\end{itemize}

The price of insurance also affects people's desire to buy to some extent, and an increase
in the price of insurance may lead to a decrease in their desire to buy.

\begin{equation}
N = (1-\omega y) N_A
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Total~Revenue = y \times N
\end{equation}

\noindent where

\begin{itemize}
\item $N_A$ is the total local population,
\item $N$ is the number of local people with a strong desire to buy,
\item $\omega$ is the factor that influences the price of insurance on the willingness of locals to buy, and is related to the average disposable income of locals as well as the gap between the rich and the poor,
\item $Total~Revenue$ is the projected total local insurance revenue.
\end{itemize}

The company first determines the area in which it wants to invest money to build the
insurance and then determines the price of local insurance. We would like to maximize the
company's total revenue:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& \max ~~ Total~Revenue \\
& \text{s.t.} ~~ 
\begin{cases}                % cases环境生成左大括号
0 < \omega y < 1 \\
y \geqslant y_{10} \\
y < 0.05 \times GNI
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $y_{10}$ is the price of insurance when the firm's insolvency rate is $10$ percent.

Our model is implemented in Gorontalo, Indonesia and Los Angeles, California. This is
because both locations have similar and high risk indices, with Los Angeles having the highest
disaster risk index in the United States.

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Location of the two areas on the map} \label{fig4}
\end{figure}

After searching for relevant data, we calculated that in order to ensure that the probability
of the company's bankruptcy after investing in catastrophe insurance in Gorontalo is less than
$10\%$, we need to charge a premium of $\$342.745$ for every $\$10,000$ of coverage, which is calculated
in equation \eqref{eq14}, of which $\$283.465$ is the pure premium and $\$59.28$ is the additional
premium. Searching for relevant information we find that $5\%$ of the per capita disposable income (GNI) of 
Gorontalo is only $\$137.25$, so the likelihood of residents being willing to purchase
catastrophe insurance is low and the company should not invest in catastrophe insurance
in the area.

In order to ensure that the probability of insolvency of the company after investing in
catastrophe insurance in Los Angeles is less than $10\%$, through the formula \eqref{eq14} 
calculated that for every $\$10,000$ of coverage need to charge a premium of $\$295.09$ of 
which the pure premium is $\$200$ and the additional premium is $\$95.09$ (because of the higher 
return on investment in the market in the U.S.). The per capita disposable income in 
Los Angeles ($5\%$ of GNI is $\$3,162.65$), which is much higher than the cost of catastrophe 
insurance. In order to determine the most appropriate cost of insurance to earn a greater benefit, 
we plotted the trend of total premium income as a function of premiums.

\begin{figure}[H]    % H表示强制固定在当前位置
\small
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig5.jpg}
\caption{Relationship between company revenue and insurance price in Los Angeles} \label{fig5}
\end{figure}

From the Figure \ref{fig5}, it can be seen that with the increase of premiums, the total income of
insurance companies tends to increase first and then decrease. This is because when the premium
is too low, although the number of insured people is high, the amount of single transaction
is small and the number of guarantees is too high, which leads to a higher risk of bankruptcy
of the insurance company; whereas too high a premium will reduce the consumer's expectations
of catastrophe insurance, and the volume of insurance orders will be small.

In summary, for Los Angeles, a premium of about $2,500$ per $\$10,000$ of coverage can be
used, and $1.92$ million people are expected to purchase the company's catastrophe insurance
(the total population of Los Angeles is about $3.79$ million). At this point, the insurance company's
theoretical revenue would be around $\$4.5$ billion. Although Los Angeles has a high risk
index, the profits are equally attractive, so the insurance company could take the risk of launching
its catastrophe insurance business here.

\subsection{Measures}

\subsubsection{Insurance Securitization}

Catastrophe bonds are risk-linked securities that transfer a specified set of risks from a
sponsor to investors. Catastrophe bonds emerged from a need by insurance companies to alleviate
some of the risks they would face if a major catastrophe occurred, which would incur
damages that they could not cover by the invested premiums \cite{jaffee1997, froot1999}. An insurance company issues
bonds through an investment bank, which are then sold to investors. These bonds are inherently
risky, and usually have maturities less than 3 years. If no catastrophe occurred, the insurance
company would pay a coupon to the investors. But if a catastrophe did occur, then the principal
would be forgiven and the insurance company would use this money to pay their claim-holders.

\begin{figure}[H]    % H表示强制固定在当前位置

\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{fig6.jpg}
\caption{Insurance securitization schema} \label{fig6}
\end{figure}

From an economic perspective, the securitization of insurance, particularly through instruments
like catastrophe bonds, represents a significant innovation in the capital markets.
This innovation not only diversifies investment opportunities but also plays a crucial role in
enhancing the resilience of the insurance industry against catastrophic events. Catastrophe
bonds allow insurance companies to transfer the risk of extreme events, such as natural disasters,
to the capital markets, thereby reducing their potential liability and improving their solvency.
This mechanism enables insurance firms to manage their risk exposure more effectively
and to maintain stability in the face of potentially ruinous events. By doing so, it also ensures
that insurance companies can continue to offer coverage for risks that might otherwise be uninsurable
due to their catastrophic potential.

\subsubsection{Co-operation with the Government}

The government plays an important role in the country. The government can make some
appealing policies to stimulate people to buy insurance and cooperate with insurance companies
to undertake part of the risk. When people buy insurance, individuals are only required to bear part of the premium. The remainder is subsidized by the various levels of government. If
necessary, special groups of people may be fully covered by government finances \cite{michel2011}. When a
catastrophe occurs, the government can act as a reinsurer and bear part of the amount of compensation.
If the amount of compensation is small, the insurance company will pay directly.
Otherwise, it can be covered or partially paid by the government. In this way, a multi-layered
diversification of risk is constructed. It not only brings benefit protection to the people, but also
drives the development of the insurance industry \cite{aase1992}.

\subsubsection{The Implementation of Measures}

Through the two scenarios described above, the insurance company's market return on
investment in the Gorontalo region $r_m$ increased. When a natural disaster occurs, the amount
of compensation paid by the insurance company is shared by the insurance company, the investors
in the insurance securities, and the local government. In addition, the government subsidizes
residents for catastrophe insurance, which increases the willingness of residents to purchase
catastrophe insurance and reduces the actual cost paid by individuals. The insurance
company can set premiums at the lowest premium ($\$295.09$) that can be assumed under the
risk of insolvency. We plot the trend of total premium income as a function of premium at this
point in time.

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig7.jpg}
\caption{The Analog trend of total premium income in Gorontalo} \label{fig7}
\end{figure}

As we can see from the picture. Under the company's affordable insolvency risk, the insurer
expects maximum revenues of $\$245$ million. The company expects maximum revenue is
$\$245$ million. At this time ,each $\$10,000$ of insurance amount charges $\$295.09$ of insurance
premiums. We expect $830,255$ people (about $73.26\%$ of the total population) to have catastrophic
insurance. Gorontalo residents pay only $\$137.25$ individually, and the remainder is
subsidized by the Gorontalo government. The government guarantees the legal rights of Gorontalo
residents as well as their social welfare.

\subsection{Real Estate Decision Making}

Our insurance model has a significant impact on the development decisions of real estate developers. Based on the above model derivation, it can be learned that for areas with high
natural disasters and low per capita income, if the insurance company is willing to underwrite
policies, it will result in the high bankruptcy rate of the company not being able to realize
profitability \cite{blanchard1994}. Similarly, real estate developers will not choose the area for investment and development
due to high risk and lack of demand. That is, any area with high R value and income
(GNI) below a certain value is not recommended for real estate developers to invest in. In
addition to this, such areas have the following risk factors: 

\begin{figure}[H]    % H表示强制固定在当前位置
\small
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig8.jpg}
\caption{Risk factors} \label{fig8}
\end{figure}

Further applying our model, we can calculate the insurance rate, which is the insurance
premium divided by insurance amount. If the area has a high insurance rate by calculating,
the property developer would have to bear a higher insurance cost during the construction of
the building as well as during the unsold period. Therefore, property developers need to carefully
consider and weigh the future profit and loss before making decisions.

Similarly, in other areas, we can calculate local insurance rates based on our model. According
to this indicator, property developer can further determine the cost of developing land
in local area and buying insurance. In this way we provide a reference for the property developer’s
decision making.

Additionally, our model can also provide guidance about how property developers build
construction. For each of the $18$ hazard types, we can calculate the value of EAL and Rvalue (in
dollars) for each hazard type. We find a positive correlation between EAL and Rvalue to some
extent. Thus, property developers can determine the different major hazrard type for each area
based on Rvalue and thus build different types of homes. For example, in the city of New Orleans,
USA, flooding ranks high on the list of $18$ natural disasters in terms of Rvalue. Accordingly,
many property companies, such as American Restorators LLC, are building houses with high
foundations locally to minimize damage and achieve business profitability. Our model solves
the problem about how to build on certain site. This approach not only maintains the interests
of real property developers, but also protects the lives of people in the community.

\section{Building Preservation Model}

\subsection{Building Value Quantification}

Building value is measured in terms of the building's cultural value and community influence,
economic value, and historical value. Therefore, we take these three main aspects as primary
indicators.

\subsubsection{Indicators Determination}

For the cultural value and community influence, we synthesized various factors, such as
geography and network, and finally selected the three most representative secondary indicators
to construct our model. Similarly, for the economic and historical value, we selected two secondary
indicators each to improve the model. The specific description and indicators selected
are shown in Table \ref{tbl3}.

         & DP         & Degree of preservation
\end{tblr}
\end{table}


\begin{itemize}
\item Cultural Value and Community Influence
\begin{description}
\item [$\circ$] Global Visibility

The cultural value of a building depends to a large extent on its global visibility. So we
quantify its global visibility through two metrics, ``Number of Google search terms''
(NG) and ``Annual number of visitors'' (ANV). This approach balances online and offline,
making the measurement of cultural values more quantifiable and accurate.

\item [$\circ$] Impact on the Community

Buildings have a strong connection with local communities. When measuring the value
of a building, we take into account its impact on the local community. Research has
shown that the more influence a building has on the local community, the more the
value of the landmark itself will increase. Besides, it will further promote the increase
of influence, realizing a positive feedback loop. Therefore, we choose ``Participation in
events held around the building'' (P) to quantify the building's influence on the community.
We calculate P as follows:

\begin{equation}
P = \frac{1}{N} \times \sum_{i = 1}^N \frac{NCMP_i}{NTC_i}
\end{equation}

where $NCMP_i$ represents ``Number of community members participating in activities''
at the $i$th activity, $NTC_i$ means the total number of people in the community at the
time of the $i$th activity and N means the total number of activities conducted around
the building.

\end{description}

\item Economy Value

For economic value, we mainly consider the value of the building in terms of its construction.
Therefore, we considered the value of the land it occupies. And it is measured
by the indicator ``Land value'' (LV).

\begin{equation}
LV = P_c \times Area
\end{equation}

where $P_c$ represents the current price of the land and Area represents the area occupied by
the building. Meanwhile, for the value created during the construction of the building itself,
we use ``Construction cost'' (CC) for quantitative assessment. Taking inflation into account,
we define Construction cost as all costs involved in the implementation of that construction
project under this year's Engineering News-Record (ENR) benchmark for the region. Both
the $LV$ and $CC$ metrics are expressed in U.S. dollars.

\item Historic Value

\begin{description}
\item [$\circ$] Historical Research Value

The historical value of a building is largely dependent on its place in historical research.
So we quantify its visibility and importance in the academic world through NH. NH
refers to the number of historical research documents related to the building, including
but not limited to books, papers, reports, etc. This indicator reflects the building's attention
and depth of research in the historical community. The higher NH value means
the building has a higher historical research value.

\item [$\circ$] The Preservation Condition

The historic value of a building is also affected by its state of preservation. We use
``Degree of preservation'' (DP) to measure the extent to which a building has been preserved
from its original state. It includes aspects such as structural integrity, exterior
preservation, and interior decoration. The assessment of DP can be based on expert
review, preservation grade, and comparative analysis with the original state. Highly
preserved buildings not only better transmit history and culture, but also provide rich
materials for future research.
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Weight Calculation}

CRITIC is an objective assignment method based on data volatility. The idea of this
method was based on two indicators, contrast intensity and correlation indicators. When calculating
the weights, we need to multiply the contrast intensity with the correlation indicator
and then normalize to get the final weights.

\begin{itemize}
\item Contrast intensity refers to the magnitude of the difference in values between evaluation
programs for the same indicator, expressed as a standard deviation. The larger the standard
deviation, the greater the fluctuation . That is, the larger the difference in the values taken between
the programs, the higher the weight will be.
\item The Sperman correlation coefficient is used to express the correlation between indicators.
If there is a strong positive correlation between two indicators, it means that the less conflicting
they are, the lower the weight will be.
\end{itemize}

1) There are $n$ samples to be evaluated and $p$ evaluation indicators to form the raw indicator
data matrix.
\[
X = \begin{pmatrix}
x_{11} & \cdots & x_{1p} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
x_{n1} & \cdots & x_{np}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

where $x_{ij}$ represents the value of the $j$th evaluation indicator for the $i$th sample.

2) In order to remove the effect of the scale each indicator is normalized. The indicators
we selected are of benefit attributes type, so the normalization formula:
\[
X_{ij} = \frac{x_{ij}-\min(x_j)}{\max(x_j)-\min(x_j)}
\]
\noindent where $X_{ij}$ is normalized to obtain a numerical matrix.

3) Then we calculate the contrast intensity of the indicator:
\[
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
& \bar{x_j} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{ij} \\
& S_j = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{ij}-\bar{x_j})^2}{n-1}}
\end{aligned}
\right.
\]
\noindent where $S_j$ represents the strength of comparison of the $j$th indicator.

The larger the $S_j$, the greater the difference in values for that indicator. The more information
the indicator reflects, the stronger the evaluation strength of the indicator itself and
the more weight should be assigned to it.

4) Calculation of the conflicting nature of the indicators
\[
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
& d_i = \mathrm{rank}(x_{ij})- \mathrm{rank}(x_{ik}) \\
& r_{jk} = 1-\frac{6 \sum d_i^2}{n (n^2-1)} \\
& R_j = \sum_{k=1,k\neq j}^p (1-r_{jk})
\end{aligned}
\right.
\]
\noindent where $R_{jk}$ denotes the Sperman correlation coefficient between evaluation indicators $j$ and
$k$. $R_j$ denotes the conflictual of the $j$th indicator.

The Sperman correlation coefficient is used to express the correlation between indicators.
The stronger the correlation between two indicators, the less they conflict, the more they reflect
the same information, and the more repetitive the content of the evaluation is. To a certain
extent, the evaluation strength of the indicator is weakened and the weight assigned to it should
be reduced.

5) Calculation of the amount of information:
\[
C_j = S_j \times R_j
\]

6) Based on the amount of information, we calculate the weights of each indicator defined
$w_j$:
\[
w_j = \frac{C_j}{\sum_{j=1}^p C_j}
\]

7) The score for each indicator is:
\[
Score_{object} = \sum_{j=1}^p w_j s_j
\]
\noindent where $object$ represents ``Cultural values and community influence'', ``Economy'', ``History'',
$s_j$ denotes the value of the $j$th secondary indicator.

Applying the CRITIC weighting method for each level 1 indicator separately, the objective
weights for each level 2 indicator were obtained as shown in the following Table \ref{tbl1}.

\subsubsection{Quantitative Results of Building Values}

In order to assign weights to these three level 1 indicators to get the final building value,
we use hierarchical analysis to construct a judgment matrix to get the weights of the three level
1 indicators:
\[
\theta = (0.4432, 0.3873, 0.1694)
\]
\noindent where the consistency ratio of the judgment matrix $= 0.017591$, and the consistency is acceptable.
Ultimately, our building impact score is calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
V_{score} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \theta_i Score_{object}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Determination of protection measures}

\subsubsection{Measure Score}

In Model 1, we obtained a composite risk score $R_{score}$ of each region by analyzing $18$
natural hazards. Next, in the above section, we quantified the value of the building to get the
score $V_{score}$. By multiplying the risk score and the value score, $M_{score}$ is obtained, which is
used to assess the conservation priority of the building and the extent and scale of conservation
measures that need to be taken.

\begin{equation}
M_{score} = V_{score} \times R_{score}
\end{equation}

A higher $M_{score}$ indicates a higher value of the building, along with a higher risk of exposure
to natural hazards. Therefore, more urgent and comprehensive protection measures are
needed. Based on the statistical distribution of $M_{score}$, we set reasonable thresholds to recognize
low, medium, and heigh grades, and the values of the specific thresholds need to be set
based on expert recommendations and industry standards.

\subsubsection{Score of Protection Measures}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Low:} For low-grade $M_{score}$ buildings, basic conservation measures, such as routine
maintenance and inspections and, where necessary, minor repairs, are undertaken. The risk or
value of these buildings is low, so the measures taken are mainly preventive and low-cost.
\item {\bf Medium:} For medium-grade $M_{score}$, moderate protection measures are implemented, including
enhanced structural inspections, improved safety features, and disaster preparedness
programs. These measures aim to increase the resistance and resilience of buildings and require
moderate investment.
\item {\bf High:} For high-grade $M_{score}$, implement comprehensive and high-intensity protection
measures. This may include comprehensive structural reinforcement, installation of advanced
security systems, and customized risk management plans in cooperation with external experts.
Given the high risk or value of these buildings, the goal of the measures is to minimize potential
losses, even if this means higher initial costs.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Note that:} The ``one-size-fits-all'' approach to disaster protection measures ignores the impact
of regional differences, architectural characteristics and socio-economic factors, and can
lead to poor protection and resource utilization. So specific protection measures still need to be
derived from a thoughtful local analysis by natural disaster experts.

\subsubsection{Mentoring for Community Leaders}

Our model provides a quantitative and systematic framework for community leaders to
help them determine the extent and priority of preservation measures based on a building's risk

and value scores. The model makes the decision-making process more scientific and accurate
by combining risk scores (which consider threats such as natural hazards) and value scores
(which include historical, cultural, economic, and community importance). It promotes optimal
allocation of resources and ensures that high-value or high-risk buildings are adequately protected,
while also taking into account economic benefits. In addition, the model encourages
community involvement and support, improves disaster response capacity, and supports sustainable
community development. Through this approach, community leaders are able to make
more informed decisions to protect and maintain important buildings in their neighborhoods,
contributing to the overall well-being and development of the community.

\section{Landmark Case Analysis}

We select Tokyo Tower in Japan as the landmark for evaluation and analysis.

\begin{figure}[H]    % H表示强制固定在当前位置
\small
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig9.jpg}
\caption{Location of Tokyo Tower} \label{fig9}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Insurance Pricing for Tokyo Tower}

Designed by Japanese architect Tachu Naito, the Tokyo Tower cost $\$8.4$ million to build
at the time and was constructed to send broadcast signals in Tokyo. Currently, Tokyo's GNI
per capita is $\$36,964.96$, and the Tokyo capital market is currently functioning well. The risk
score for Tokyo is calculated to be 86. According to the insurance pricing model, the optimal
insurance rate for an insurance company to issue catastrophe insurance in Tokyo is $3.8\%$. In
view of the special historical value of the Tokyo Tower, the insurance company may appropriately
increase the insurance rate. As a result, the Tokyo government spends approximately US
$\$319,200$ per year on catastrophe insurance for the Tokyo Tower.

\subsection{Architectural Value of Tokyo Tower}

In 2011, a major earthquake struck northeastern Japan, and this earthquake caused some
damage to Tokyo Tower, bending the antenna at the tip of the tower by $2$ degrees, resulting in
the end of the experimental broadcasting of terrestrial wave digital sound broadcasting, and the
interruption of the transmission of the $24/7$ terrestrial analog television signals. 
Tokyo Tower entered a maintenance period during which analog signals and FM broadcasting-related services
also began to be transferred to Tokyo Skytree, so the proportion of Tokyo Tower's actual
use gradually decreased. However, Tokyo Tower has attracted more than $3$ million visitors as
a tourist attraction and has accumulated more than $150$ million visitors. It is also a symbol of
Japan's post-war prosperity and has a remarkable historical significance for the Japanese people.

According to the calculations of the building conservation model, the Mscore of Tokyo
Tower is located in a high conservation level area. Therefore, the government should consider
purchasing catastrophe insurance for Tokyo Tower and strengthening its daily supervision and
maintenance to ensure that it can withstand natural disasters, such as earthquakes, and that its
seismic treatment measures also need to be strengthened.

\section{Sensitivity and Robustness Analysis}

\subsection{Sensitivity}

In section 4.3, factor is introduced to estimate the parameters of the expected return
of the market. Therefore, change the size of this parameter, that is, the capital market environment
has changed. Below we analyze the sensitivity of this parameter. Gradual reduction of
the parameter by $5\%$. The reason for considering only a decrease in r and not an increase in r
is to reflect the worst-case scenario, i.e. a gradual decrease in capital market returns, and to see
if our model is sensitive to the parameter.

Therefore, Re-simulate the calculation results and obtain $3$ sets of curves as shown in
Figure \ref{fig10}.

% 并排两个图(非子图)
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{floatrow}
\ffigbox[\FBwidth]
{
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fig10.jpg}
}
{\caption{Sensitivity analysis of $r_m$} \label{fig10}}
\ffigbox[\FBwidth]
{
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fig11.jpg}
}
{\caption{Robustness analysis of $R_{value}$} \label{fig11}}
\end{floatrow}
\end{figure}

The results show that as r decreases, the profit gained by the insurance company if it sells
the insurance company at the same price tends to decrease. This makes sense because lower
capital market interest rates result in lower profits for insurance companies. The trend of the
curve obtained by sensitivity test is consistent with the actual situation.

\subsection{Robustness}

We verify the robustness of the model. Given the uncertainty of natural hazards, we may
have errors in the calculation of Rvalue, which affects our grading of the risk indicators for each
region. Randomly selecting some of the more than $3,000$ counties in the United States and
deviating its Rvalue by $5\%$, and again grading these areas, the results obtained are shown in
Figure \ref{fig11}.

As can be seen from the figure, the grading of the original regions changes only slightly
after randomly selecting regions to bias their measurements. This indicates that the small error
in $R$ does not cause large changes in the model results and our model is stable.


\section{Model Evaluation}

\subsection{Strengths}

{\bf Robustness and Flexibility:} Our model demonstrates strong adaptability to various parameter
variations through sensitivity analysis and robustness testing, and is able to provide
reliable predictions under different scenarios.

{\bf Comprehensive consideration:} Our model integrates social and economic factors, natural
disaster risks, and provides a way to price insurance.

\subsection{Weaknesses}

{\bf Data Dependency:} Although the model has a high demand for data quality, it reflects our
scientific attitude of pursuing accuracy and real-time performance. By working with data providers,
we can continuously optimize the data collection and processing process.
